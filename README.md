# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN

You can train the model locally on ur pc or on kaggle.
i will recommend kaggle if your PC dont hv GPU,since the training will take long time.
I have used python version 3.10 and Tensorflow version 2.10 
Note -: Tensorflow is not supported on python 3.11 so be sure use proper interpreter.
